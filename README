ASSIGNMENT 1: SINGLE PAGE APP


All of the code in this assignment was written by Kevin Diez-Ocampo, excluding: node and js native libraries, jquery,
and npm colour module

DISCLAIMER:

I used the colour npm module on this assignment. This was  only for logging purposes and does not help me in any
way towards completing the assignment requirements.


INSTRUCTIONS:

This app was developed on Ubuntu 16.04. It might be able to run under Windows, however, you
will have to rewrite the .txt files inside the 'songs' directory because the current songs have unix line breaks.


1. To start the server run app.js. The server will be listening for incoming requests on port 3000.

2. The homepage for the app is on localhost:3000/. This url will open a webpage where you can select songs from a list

3. To select a song, pick a song from the dropdown and press the 'Get Song' button.

4. The song should appear on the screen. Feel free to drag the words around.

5 To save changes to the song, press the 'Save' button or press 'Undo changes' to restore song to previous state.
